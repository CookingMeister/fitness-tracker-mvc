## Description

As a fitness enthusiast, I want a comprehensive fitness tracker that allows me to log various types of workouts, track my water intake, and monitor my daily steps, so that I can have a detailed overview of my fitness progress and health habits to better achieve my personal health goals.

Once the application is loaded, the home page will be the start of your fitness journey<br>

From the homescreen, if you are a new user you will click register to take you to anmother page where you can choose your username and password. If you are a returning user, then you will click the log in button to take you to a page with inputs to enter your existing credentials<br>

Once logged in, you will be redirected to the dashboard, where you can see 6 cards. One for your profile data and 5 others to log cardio, workout, sleep, water and step<br>

When you want to log something like a cardio workout, when you click the add button 3 input fields will appear in a modal: Exercise, Distance in KM, Time in minutes<br>

After you log your cardio workout, an encouraging message wil display at the bottom of the screen<br>

If you click the cardio card outside of the button you can see your logged exercise. If you want to delete it, there is a checkbox beside your entry and a delete buttom at the botton<br>

Workout, Water, Sleep and Steps all have the same functionalities and come with encouraging messages also! Lastly, when you are all finished, you can log out of your account with the logout button on the top right of the dashboard<br>
